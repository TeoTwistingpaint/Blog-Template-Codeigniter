# Blog Template - Codeigniter

Simple project developed using codeigniter framework as a template for a website with news and an admin's panel to manage the articles.

## Installation

Download and copy the project in the root folder of your server (es. XAMPP) and start it. You have to change the settings in config.php because I use a different port, in my case is 3307. Import the database in your phpmyadmin panel.

## Usage

To log-in click on the icon in the header and use the following credentials:

username: admin

password: password
